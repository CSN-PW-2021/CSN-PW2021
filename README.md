Purpose based that will help in easy workflow between organisation 3.To socialise in a official and verified manner.
To Increase the reach and approach of each members to anyone in organisation. 5.Help in increase productivity and development. !..............................................................................................................................................................................! Since, the pandemic is in action the works and organisation have almost conveted in virtual mode but a sudden conversion was tough and not relaible. Rather any organisation got distributed on different platforms to use their resources they can choose this instead.
